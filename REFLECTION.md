# 1. Accuracy: Were your predictions right?
My predictions about the caffeine were not good. They were partially correct. 
While I accurately predicted that "Sunday" would have the highest screen time due to
weekend relaxation, I was wrong about caffeine. I predicted it would increase focus, but
the data showed my focus was actually higher on days with "lower caffeine intake", 
such as Tuesday and Thursday. Three cups on Wednesday suggests that the "stress" means I
reach for caffeine only when I am already struggling to concentrate.

# 2. Surprises: What surprised you?
I was surprised by my data from "Wednesday". I recorded "stressed as my mood" yet that day
actually showed a decent focus level. It made me realize that stress doesn't always equal
low productivity; sometimes, perhaps one cup helps me stay on task.

# 3. What was tricky or rewarding?
This program was such a technical challenge. The most challenging part of this project was 
working with "nested data inside an array of objects". Specifically, understanding why we use
the `.reduce()` method to calculate averages.  That required careful attention to syntax to make sure
the object property was (`entry.sleepHours`) on the averageSleep() function. Debugging the
`mostFrequentMood()` function was also a great exercise in learning how to use key-value pairs
to count occurrences. Use of entry.screenTime, entry.sleepHours, and entry.mood.

# 4. How did using your own data change things?
The personal impact of the program was that seeing my life represented as data points makes
problem-solving easier. It changed my perspective by showing me that my habits are part
of visible data. Like seeing the link between late-night screen time
and next-day mood has made me more aware of my actions.
