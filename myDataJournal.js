//Predictions:
// 1. I think the most screen time is Sunday as opposed to our example data journal posted which was on Wednesday.
// 2. My prediction for the best focus would be on Tuesday because of getting enough sleep and caffeine intake.
// 3. Caffeine impact would be Wednesday because of the most intake, thus higher focus.

//Make an Array of Objects
